Are Pandas a type of bear? it depends. For many decades, the precise taxonomic classification of the giant panda was under debate because it shares characteristics with both bears and raccoons.[18] However, molecular studies indicate the giant panda is a true bear, part of the family Ursidae.[6][19] These studies show it differentiated early (about 19 million years ago)[20] from the main ursine stock; since it is the most basal member of the group, it is equidistant from all other extant ursids.[21][20] The giant panda has been referred to as a living fossil.[22]

Despite the shared name, habitat type, and diet, as well as a unique enlarged bone called the pseudo thumb (which helps them grip the bamboo shoots they eat) the giant panda and red panda are only distantly related.
